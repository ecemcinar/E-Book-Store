# E-Book-Store
The project is designed as a website using ASP.NET CORE.

For front-end, it is used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and for backend, C# and MSSQL are used.

The functionality of the application is divided into two parts: What administrators and users,
called readers, can do. Administrators have a high activity in the system whilst normal users
are limited in what they can do.
